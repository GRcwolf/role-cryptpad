#+title: Cryptpad role
#+author: Chris Wolf <chris@chriswolf.ch>

This is a simple role that installs cryptpad.

It is quite oppinionated and may not meet your needs.

* Requirements
The role uses a systemd service.
It also assumes that nodejs and npm are already present by other means.
The role can create an nginx config but it won't install nginx.

* Configuration
There are many variables you can adjust to configure the role.
